# Coding assignment follow up

In my opinion the most important libraries I've used
in this assignment are `ExpressJs` used for serving data on the backend.
On the frontend these are
- `ReactJs` for the front-end library,
- `Axios` for data fetching, 
- `Mui` for the tabs, and
- `Victory` for rendering the data.

I chose `React` because I'm familiar with the library, `Axios` goes hand in hand with `React`,
and `Victory` is a `D3Js` wrapper for `React`.

During this assignment I've learned what NMR spectroscopy and spectral data are and how to render this data on the internet.

I've focused on both the frontend and the backend, but also found that the front end need more of my time due to its complexity.

All in all I've spend about 6 hours on this assignment. If I were to spend more time on this assignment
I'd add testing, I'd possible add more component to the frontend, and would use `GraphQL` instead of REST.
I found the test to be interesting and neither too complex or too simple and I wouldn't add much to it.
